        "\n",
        "4. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Pandas offers functions for handling missing data, duplicate data, and data type conversion.\n",
        "    - Methods like `dropna()`, `fillna()`, `drop_duplicates()`, `astype()`, etc., are commonly used for data cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Manipulation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Pandas provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation, including filtering rows, selecting columns, sorting, grouping, aggregating, and pivoting.\n",
        "    - Methods like `groupby()`, `merge()`, `concat()`, `pivot_table()`, `stack()`, `unstack()`, etc., are used for various data manipulation tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Data Visualization**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Pandas integrates seamlessly with Matplotlib and other visualization libraries for data visualization.\n",
        "    - DataFrames and Series have built-in plotting methods (`plot()`), which provide a quick way to create basic plots such as line plots, scatter plots, histograms, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Time Series Data**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Pandas has extensive support for working with time series data.\n",
        "    - It provides specialized data structures like `Timestamp` and `DatetimeIndex` for representing dates and times.\n",
        "    - Pandas offers time series-specific functions for resampling, shifting, rolling window calculations, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Input/Output**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Pandas supports reading and writing data from/to various file formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, HTML, and HDF5.\n",
        "    - Methods like `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, `to_csv()`, `to_excel()`, etc., facilitate input/output operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Pandas is designed for performance and efficiency, especially for handling large datasets.\n",
        "    - It leverages optimized and vectorized operations using underlying libraries like NumPy, which makes it faster than traditional Python loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Pandas is a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis in Python, offering a wide range of functionality for working with structured data efficiently and effectively. Whether you're cleaning messy data, performing complex transformations, or conducting in-depth analysis, Pandas provides the tools you need to get the job done."

        "### **Why pandas instead of Numpy and what are limitations of Numpy?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas and NumPy are both popular libraries in Python for data manipulation and analysis, but they serve different purposes and have different strengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Numeric Operations**: NumPy is optimized for numerical operations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Low-Level**: NumPy provides low-level data structures, allowing for more control over memory usage and performance optimizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Efficiency**: NumPy operations are typically faster than traditional Python operations due to its implementation in C.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Array-based**: NumPy primarily focuses on array-based computation, making it ideal for numerical computing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, NumPy has some limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Structured Data Handling**: NumPy lacks high-level data structures to handle structured data with mixed data types, such as tables or data frames.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Manipulation**: NumPy doesn't have built-in functionalities for data manipulation tasks like grouping, pivoting, or joining datasets, which are common in data analysis workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Label-based Indexing**: NumPy arrays are indexed using integer indices, making it less intuitive for tasks that require label-based indexing, such as accessing data by column names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **High-Level Data Structures**: Pandas provides high-level data structures like Series and DataFrame that are designed for handling structured data efficiently. These data structures are built on top of NumPy arrays, providing a more intuitive interface for data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Analysis Tools**: Pandas offers a wide range of tools for data analysis, including data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Label-based Indexing**: Pandas supports label-based indexing, allowing users to access data by column names or row indices, which makes data manipulation tasks more intuitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Integration with Other Libraries**: Pandas integrates well with other Python libraries like Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and machine learning tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while NumPy excels in numerical computation and array manipulation, Pandas is better suited for data manipulation and analysis tasks, especially when dealing with structured data. Combining both libraries allows for a comprehensive data analysis workflow in Python."

        "\n",
        "In Pandas, properties and functions play different roles in the manipulation and analysis of data. Let's define each:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Property**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A property in Pandas refers to an attribute or characteristic of a DataFrame or Series object.\n",
        "    - Properties provide access to metadata or information about the data without executing any computation.\n",
        "    - Examples of properties in Pandas include `shape`, `dtypes`, `index`, and `columns` for DataFrames, and `dtype`, `name`, `index`, and `values` for Series.\n",
        "    - Properties are accessed without parentheses, similar to accessing attributes of an object in Python.\n",
        "    - They provide information about the structure, size, and data types of the DataFrame or Series.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Function**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A function in Pandas refers to a callable object that performs a specific action or computation on a DataFrame or Series.\n",
        "    - Functions in Pandas are typically used to transform, manipulate, analyze, or visualize data.\n",
        "    - Functions can be methods of DataFrame or Series objects, or they can be standalone functions that accept DataFrame or Series objects as arguments.\n",
        "    - Examples of functions in Pandas include `head()`, `tail()`, `describe()`, `info()`, `groupby()`, `apply()`, `plot()`, and many others.\n",
        "    - Functions are invoked with parentheses, and they may accept arguments to customize their behavior.\n",
        "    - They perform operations on the data, such as summarization, aggregation, filtering, sorting, merging, reshaping, and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, properties in Pandas provide information about the data structure and metadata, while functions perform operations and computations on the data itself. Understanding the distinction between properties and functions is essential for effectively working with Pandas objects and analyzing data."

        "- **Input**: A Pandas Series object.\n",
        "- **Output**: Returns a new Series containing counts of unique values in the input Series, sorted in descending order by default.\n",
        "- **Usage**:\n",
        "  - Often used to examine the frequency distribution of categorical data.\n",
        "  - It can be applied to a single column of a DataFrame to count occurrences of each unique value in that column.\n",
        "- **Parameters**:\n",
        "  - `normalize`: If set to True, returns the relative frequencies (proportions) of unique values instead of counts.\n",
        "  - `sort`: If set to True, sorts the result by frequencies in descending order.\n",
        "  - `ascending`: If set to True, sorts the result in ascending order.\n",
        "  - `dropna`: If set to True, excludes missing values (NaN) from the result.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Create a Series\n",

        "**`df.drop()`** is a Pandas method used to remove rows or columns from a DataFrame based on specified labels or indices. Here's a short description of its functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Method**: `df.drop()`\n",
        "- **Input**:\n",
        "  - For removing rows: List or array-like object containing labels or indices of rows to be dropped.\n",
        "  - For removing columns: List or array-like object containing labels or indices of columns to be dropped.\n",
        "- **Output**: Returns a new DataFrame with the specified rows or columns removed.\n",
        "- **Usage**:\n",
        "  - Typically used to eliminate unwanted rows or columns from a DataFrame.\n",
        "- **Parameters**:\n",
        "  - `labels`: Labels or indices of rows or columns to be dropped.\n",
        "  - `axis`: Specifies whether to drop rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`). Default is 0 (rows).\n",
        "  - `index`: Alternative to the `labels` parameter for specifying row labels to be dropped.\n",
        "  - `columns`: Alternative to the `labels` parameter for specifying column labels to be dropped.\n",
        "  - `inplace`: If set to True, modifies the DataFrame in place and returns None.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Create a DataFrame\n",

        "     A\n",
        "  0  1\n",
        "  1  2\n",
        "  2  3\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- **Note**: By default, `df.drop()` returns a new DataFrame with the specified rows or columns removed, while the original DataFrame remains unchanged. If you want to modify the original DataFrame in place, you can use the `inplace=True` parameter."

        "The code **`df.index** = ['a','w','c']` assigns a new index to the DataFrame `df`. Here's an explanation of what it does and its functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Code**: `df.index = ['a','w','c']`\n",
        "- **Functionality**:\n",
        "  - The DataFrame `df` has an index, which is a set of labels that identify each row in the DataFrame.\n",
        "  - By default, the index of a DataFrame is numeric and starts from 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, where N is the number of rows.\n",
        "  - However, you can customize the index to use labels of your choice instead of the default numeric index.\n",
        "  - In the given code, `['a','w','c']` is a list of labels. By assigning this list to `df.index`, you are specifying that the DataFrame `df` should use these labels as its index.\n",
        "  - After executing this code, the DataFrame `df` will have a new index composed of the labels 'a', 'w', and 'c', instead of the default numeric index.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Function**:\n",
        "  - The function of this code is to change the index of the DataFrame `df` to the specified list of labels.\n",
        "  - This can be useful for various purposes, such as setting more descriptive or meaningful row labels, aligning the DataFrame with external data sources, or simplifying data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
        "  - It provides flexibility in how you organize and access your data within the DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Create a DataFrame\n",
        "  df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Assign new index\n",
        "  df.index = ['a', 'w', 'c']\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(df)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  Output:\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "     A  B\n",
        "  a  1  4\n",
        "  w  2  5\n",
        "  c  3  6\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- **Note**:\n",
        "  - When assigning a new index, ensure that the length of the index list matches the number of rows in the DataFrame, otherwise you'll get a ValueError.\n",
        "  - Customizing the index can make your DataFrame more intuitive and facilitate data analysis and manipulation tasks."

        "1. **`loc`**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - `loc` is primarily label-based indexing, meaning you can use it to access data based on row and column labels.\n",
        "    - It takes two arguments: the row label(s) and the column label(s), separated by a comma.\n",
        "    - It can accept single labels, lists of labels, or slice objects.\n",
        "    - If you provide a single label for rows or columns, `loc` returns a Series. If you provide multiple labels or a slice, it returns a DataFrame.\n",
        "    - `loc` is inclusive of both the start and stop labels when using slice notation.\n",
        "    - Example usage:\n",

        "    - `iloc` is purely integer-based indexing, allowing you to access data using integer positions of rows and columns.\n",
        "    - It works similar to Python's native indexing, where the index starts from 0.\n",
        "    - Like `loc`, it takes two arguments: integer positions for rows and columns, separated by a comma.\n",
        "    - It can accept single integers, lists of integers, or slice objects.\n",
        "    - `iloc` is exclusive of the stop index when using slice notation.\n",
        "    - Example usage:\n",
        "        ```python\n",
        "        # Access a single element\n",
        "        df.iloc[row_index, column_index]\n",
        "        \n",
        "        # Access an entire row\n",
        "        df.iloc[row_index]\n",
        "        \n",
        "        # Access a subset of rows and columns\n",
        "        df.iloc[[row_index1, row_index2], [column_index1, column_index2]]\n",
        "        \n",
        "        # Access rows and all columns using slice notation\n",
        "        df.iloc[row_index1:row_index2, :]\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, `loc` is used for label-based indexing, where you specify row and column labels, while `iloc` is used for integer-based indexing, where you specify integer positions of rows and columns. Understanding the difference between these two methods is crucial for effectively accessing and manipulating data in Pandas DataFrames."

        "- **Code**: `pd.DataFrame(df, columns=['time', 'total_bill', 'tip'])`\n",
        "- **Functionality**:\n",
        "  - The `pd.DataFrame()` function is used to create a new DataFrame object.\n",
        "  - The first argument (`df`) specifies the data that will be used to populate the new DataFrame. In this case, it refers to the existing DataFrame `df`.\n",
        "  - The `columns` parameter specifies the column labels for the new DataFrame.\n",
        "  - By specifying the `columns` parameter, you are selecting a subset of columns from the existing DataFrame `df` to include in the new DataFrame.\n",
        "  - The columns specified ('time', 'total_bill', 'tip') should exist in the original DataFrame `df`, otherwise, the new DataFrame will contain NaN (missing) values for those columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import pandas as pd\n",

        "  # Create an existing DataFrame\n",
